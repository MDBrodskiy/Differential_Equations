% Integral: $$\int_{lower}^{upper} f(x) dx$$
% Limit: $$\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)$$

\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

  \item Mathematical Model $-$ The mathematical description of a system or a phenomenon

  \item Level of Resolution $-$ The scope of variables defined in a mathematical model

  \item State of the System $-$ A solution of a model gives this. In other words, the values of the dependent variable (or variables). For example, $t$ gives us time, past, present, and future.

  \item Thomas Malthus $-$ One of the earliest people to attempt a model based on population growth. 

  \item Examples of things modeled by maths: Population growth, Radioactive decay, Lifetime of a drug in a system, Capital interest, etc.
