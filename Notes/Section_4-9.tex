\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Systematic Elimination} may be used to solve a system of linear differential equations

  \item Ex. Rewrite the system $x''+2x'+y''=x+3y+\sin t$ \eqref{1}

    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
       x''+2x'+y''&=x+3y+\sin t\\
       D^2x+2Dx-x+D^2y-3y\\
       (D^2+2D-1)x+(D^2-3)y=\sin t
      \end{split}
      \label{1}
    \end{equation}

  \item A solution of a system of differential equations is a set of sufficiently differentiable functions, $x=\phi_1(t),\, y=\phi_2(t),\, z=\phi_3(t)$, and so on that satisfies each equation in the system on some common interval $I$

\end{itemize}
