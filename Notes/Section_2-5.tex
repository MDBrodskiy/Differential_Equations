\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

  \item Often the first step in solving a differential equation consists of transforming it into another differential equation by means of a \textbf{substitution}

  \item \textbf{Homogeneous Function} $-$ A function $f$ that possesses the property $f(tx,ty)=t^{\alpha}f(x,y)$ for some real number $\alpha$

    $$M(x,y)\,dx+N(x,y)\,dy=0$$

  \item Is homogeneous if both coefficient functions $M$ and $N$ are homogeneous functions of the same degree.

  \item Either substitution, $y=ux$ or $x=vy$, will reduce a homogeneous equation to a separable first-order differential equation.

  \item \textbf{Bernoulli's Equation} $-$ An equation which fits the following form, where $n$ is any real number:

    $$\frac{dy}{dx}+P(x)y=f(x)y^n$$

  \item To solve differential equations with the given form, substitute:

    $$u=y^{1-n}$$

  \item \textbf{Reduction to Separation of Variables} $-$ A differential equation of the following form may be reduced to separation of variables when substituted with $u=Ax+By+C, B\neq0$

    $$\frac{dy}{dx}=f(Ax+By+C)$$
