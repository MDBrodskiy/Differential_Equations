\begin{itemize}

  \item An $n$th-order initial-value problem (IVP):

    $$\text{Solve: }\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}=f(x,y,y'\dots y^{n-1})$$

    $$\text{Subject to: }y(x_0)=y_0\,,y'(x_0)=y_1\dotsy^{n-1}(x_0)=y_{n-1}$$

  \item   Existence of Uniqueness of a Solution $-$ Let $R$ be a rectangular region in the xy plane defined by $a\leq x\leq b,c\leq y\leq d$ that contains the point $(x_0,y_0)$ in its interior. If $f(x,y)$ and $\partial f / \partial y$ are continuous on $R$ then there exists some interval $I_0:\,\,(x_0-h,x_0+h), h>0$ contained in $[a,b]$, and a unique function $y(x)$, defined on $I_0$, that is a solution of the first order initial value problem 

\end{itemize}
