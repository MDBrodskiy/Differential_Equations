\begin{itemize}

  \item The Dirac Delta ``Function'' may be modeled by \eqref{1}

    \begin{equation}
      \delta(t-t_0)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 0,\, & 0\leq t < t_0-a\\ \frac{1}{2a},\, & t_0-a\leq t < t_0+a\\ 0,\, & t\geq t_0 + a\\ \end{array}
      \label{1}
    \end{equation}

  \item This function could serve as a model for a big force exerted over little time (an impulse)

  \item The impulse (force over time), or the area under the graph of the force always equals 1. This means that, for a shorter period of time, the force is greater

  \item The function $\delta_a(t-t_0)$ is called the unit impulse, or the Dirac Delta Function. The limit that approximates this is defined as \eqref{2}

    \begin{equation}
      \delta (t-t_0)=\lim_{a\to0}\delta_a(t-t_0)
      \label{2}
    \end{equation}

  \item The Laplace transform is defined as \eqref{3}

    \begin{equation}
      \mathcal{L}\left\{ \delta(t-t_0) \right\}=e^{-st_0}
      \label{3}
    \end{equation}

  \item The integral of any function multiplied by the Dirac delta function is the function evaluated at the point $t_0$, or \eqref{4}

    \begin{equation}
      \int_a^{b} f(t)\delta(t-t_0)\,dt=f(t_0)
      \label{4}
    \end{equation}

\end{itemize}

\end{document}
